Multi-player web game that simulates the popular board game, Settlers of Catan. 
It includes a board where players place game pieces to claim territory, 
earning them points. Players can negotiate trades in the chatroom beside the 
board. The application integrates complex game logic to deliver an experience 
similar to playing on a table top.
